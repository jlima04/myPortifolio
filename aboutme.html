        <h1 class="basic">Quem sou eu?</h1>
                <p>My Name is Jo√£o Victor, im 20 years old, soon to be 21 in december 2022,<br>
            i first started studying Front-End in october 2021, with some long pauses throuhout,<br>
            i was born in Recife-PE, in Brazil, but i moved away to Natal-RN after my parents divorce.<br>
           </p>

           <h1>Where i went to school</h1>
            <p>I went to a kinda of well know school for almost all my life, <strong><a href="https://marista.edu.br/natal/">Marista</a></strong> , is its name.<br>
               Until the last year of high school, where i decided to leave, <br>
               to go to a completly new instituition because they had huge propositions and new ideas<br>
               and so i decided to go and finish high school there, after that i went to UFRN, to study Nutrition<br>
               but covid began to spread in Brazil and it had to be put on halt until unknow time.</p>
            <h1>How and Why i started in Front-End</h1>
            <p>As i said, i went on to study Nutrition and few friends went to IT, after a while talking to them<br>
             i noticed that IT suited me more, but i already had plans to move here to Portugal, <br>
             and so i couldn't go to a college there i had already aplied to other major here,<br> 
            so i decided to be a self-taught dev.</p>

            <h1> Work Experiences</h1>
            <p>So... being self-taught is hard, i noticed, i dont have a job yet but i learn fast <br>
             and so i think its not that far.</p>

             <p>I say that because i already have some projects and stuff going on, that's why you are seeing this.<br>
             Those projects you see for now are my marks and the sings of my growth as a WebDev, so feel free to give some criticism.</p>
